<!--put a page of collections here? literally just collection title and then all 10 collection names on a
card would be mvp - no need to waste time on pics for now - each title would open another page very similar except it's the
 recipes on cards and then when you click on them it opens /recipes page which is each recipe with carbon footprint etc-->

<!--how easy is it to make infinite recipe tiles? e.g . winter warmers maybe have 10 recipes, healthy family may have 20-->
